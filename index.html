       <p>Hi there, I'm Sarah Mohamed, and I'm on a mission to bring innovative ideas to life through code. 
        
        My journey in the tech world kicked off with YearUp, where I got hands-on experience with my coding skills. I'm all about problem-solving and love diving into GitHub to collaborate on exciting projects.

        You'll see me taking complex challenges and turning them into elegant solutions.When I'm not deep in my computer, I have a few passions that keep me going. 
        On the weekends Im always in the kitchen, constantly experimenting with new recipes. I love making new recipes or making finger food for parties and events for my friends.  
        Also, While Im not an artist at heart, you'll often find me with a paintbrush in hand experimenting, creating something unique and beautiful.
        
        
        
        Family is so important to me. I love spending time with them any chance I get. 
        
        
        
        Travel is another love of mine. I've been fortunate to explore some amazing places like Dubai, London, Kenya, and Turkey. 
        These experiences have broadened my horizons and inspired both my coding and creative projects. 
        And last but not least, I'm a cat lover through and through. My crazy feline friend, Silver, always adds a bit of joy to my day.
        
        
        
        If you want to stay connected and follow my journey in the world of software development, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm excited to share my adventures in tech, art, cooking, and travel with you. <p>
